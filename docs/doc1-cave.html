        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Cavalian Caves are a mysterious and beautiful cave system located in the mountainous regions of western Iran. Known for their unique rock formations and ancient legends, these caves remain largely unexplored by mainstream tourism.</p>

        <h2>Geological Features</h2>
        <p>Inside the Cavalian Caves, visitors will find limestone walls sculpted by centuries of water flow. Stalactites hang like chandeliers from the ceilings, and underground rivers echo through the passages. The atmosphere is cool, damp, and silent, adding to the sense of mystery.</p>

        <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
        <p>Local villagers tell stories of ancient travelers who used the caves as shelter during harsh winters. Some even believe that hidden carvings deep within the caves are remnants of a lost civilization, though no official archaeological evidence has confirmed this.</p>

        <h2>Visiting the Cavalian Caves</h2>
        <p>Access to the caves is limited, and guided tours are recommended for safety reasons. The journey includes a scenic hike through the Zagros Mountains, offering stunning views and a glimpse into Iranâ€™s rich natural landscape.</p>
